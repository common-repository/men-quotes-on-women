== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to add more quotes? =
You can add quotes by editing the men-quotes-on-women.dat file. You just have to respect the same format. More simply, if you send me the quotes I will add them to the next version of the plugin.

= Is the plugin compatible with versions of WordPress ealier to 2.8? =
No. Because of the new widget implementation, you need to use WordPress 2.8 or later. If you are using an earlier version of WordPress, you can try using Men Quotes On Women version 1.1.1 but, really, you should upgrade.
